Description of Video and Project: 

The video shows a quick snipped of the minecraft project my partner and I developed for graphics. In particular, it shows off the various 
biomes, textures, and efficient terrain generation we were able to implement. An optional feature we added was the ability to persistently 
mine and place blocks alongside the procedurally generated world. 
The movement and various components of the user experience are not optimal for an enjoyable experience but were part of the requirements
for the project's implementation. 
This project is submitted as a tech demo of sorts to demonstrate what I am technically able to accomplish under the hood in the game engine.
