Description of File: 

The shader code file determines how each block on the screen should be animated. There are no pre-generated texture maps for any of the blocks. 
Instead, we used perlin noise in order to realistic-looking, unique blocks for different biomes. There are also some special blocks
that implement time-varying perlin noise, which looks pretty cool.
