Description of Project:

John Chimp is an NFT savant in the midst of the great Gamestock stock gamma squeeze of the early 2020s. After the stock started dipping, he knew he had to buy up all the stocks to punish the shorting corporate bears. 

FORSOOTH! They discovered his plot, and then cruelly slaughtered his wife and wife’s dog. Overcome with grief over the dog, he knew what he must do - get to his computer and buy up all the stocks available before Robinhood stops the sale of Gamestock stock again so he can cling onto the one thing left in the world he truly loves - money and NFTs - so he can hang in there amidst this tragedy. They’ve taken down the elevator, so he must climb up the elevator shaft and other abnormal areas to reach his penthouse. 

Use ropes to scale the building and guns to mow down troops sent to destroy you.

I created the scripts involving camera controll and procedural stage generation. I also contributed to the project by creating the gun scripts. 

I submit these code snippets in order to show my proficiency in developing code in C# in a game design context.
