Description of Project:

Planet of the Chokes is a Tower-Defense-like game in which you attempt to ward off aliens attacking the earth from all directions. 
The twist is that placing down defensive towers causes global warming to worsen, which will increase the likelihood of farms burning down
and also possibly lead to humanity's extinction before the aliens kill you.

I submit this project to showcase my proficiency in architecting code/classes that will be used used frequently throughout projects
and my proficiency at coding entity behavior. While before working on this project I had never worked with C#, my role for this project
was creating the class structure that would be used to define entity behavior and implementing the way users place/stack towers while
avoiding collisions.

My main contributions to the project were implementing the polar object class and defining the behavior of many of the entities in the game
(including missile homing behaviors), implementing tower placement, and allowing the user to zoom into and spin the world naturally.
I am especially proud of how the tower placement turned out (the snapping behavior and so on) as detecting collision between the tower being
placed and other towers proved to be rather challenging without interfering with other parts of the game. Additionally, there is actually
a bug in the final build of the project because I forgot to push my final missile code that made them point in the right direction 
when homing, but the code I submitted here should have the final, fixed code.
