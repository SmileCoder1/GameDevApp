Description of Project:

This game can be enjoyed with 2 players or one player if you're up for a big challenge. 

The story: The scene is this - you are an elderly pig with dying organs, but you long to consume exquisite food. Against your vet's orders you plan one final quest - to raid all the farms in your state and eat everything in sight. The only problem - the farmers will stop at nothing to prevent you from raiding their stocks.  In your youth, this would've been easy, but now, you have your body to think of. Join forces with the poor cells in your body as you dare to eat what no pig has eaten before while making sure to breathe.

The game: One person plays as the pig on the outside in a crazy bullet hell while the other player makes sure you get enough oxygen and makes sure you don't get too  heavy to move out of the way of bullets in a manic resource management game.  

The mechanics: The cell on the right needs to transport oxygen to the lungs and make sure blood carries it through the body. The only catch is the pig needs to stand still to breathe. The pig fights back against the farmers by vomiting, but only if the cells load the food in the stomach. But don't stock up too much - you slow down if you have too much food in your body, so you'd better throw out the stuff you don't need out the back.

I pretty much did all the coding for the inside gameplay and also integrated the inside and outside gameplay by defining the interface between the game manager and both playable characters. I submit these code snippets to show my proficiency in developing in C#.
