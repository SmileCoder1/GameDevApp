# GameDevApp
 This porfolio includes some code snippets from 2 big game-related projects I've worked on - Planet of the Chokes, a game some friends and I designed over a weekend for the Chillenium Game Jam earlier this year, and the Minecraft project a partner and I worked on for CS 354H. 
 
 If I am accepted into CS354S, I hope to work on the game design and coding. As a quick aside that might be relevant, I am finishing up CS354H, which I heard was one of the possible pre-requisites for this class.
 
 Sorry for compiling this all so late and not putting together a full portfolio website! I hope this repository is still satisfactory, however. 
 
 Hope you're having a great day and enjoy your summer!
