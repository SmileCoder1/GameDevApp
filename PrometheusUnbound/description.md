Description of Project:

Prometheus Unbound is a 2D stealth platformer with graceful speed and machine-precision movement. Play as the monstrous machine-made-mortal, Anala. Maneuver through a neo-gothic sprawl and transform into a volatile, electric form to hunt enemies.

I submit these code snippets to showcase my proficiency in developing in C#. The AnimationController2.cs and CutSceneHandler.cs scripts were used in creating an extensible cutscene system that drastically reduced the amount of time required to create cutscenes since they allowed cutscene designers to script using in-game mechanics instead of doing frame-by-frame animation. They also supported the addition of frame-by-frame animations, however.

I also included the forced action and force input scripts that were used in both developing cutscenes and tutorials. 

I also contributed to the Stealth Movement script which controlled all of Anala's motions in the game.
